The magnetic field exerts force on the current carrying coil. This force produces a counter torque that opposes the rotational motion of coil. This effect is called back motor effect of generator.\n\n\nAccording to law of conservation of energy, the energy consumed by the load must come from the energy source used to drive turbines.\n\n\nThe larger the current drawn by the load, the greater is the counter torque produced.\n\n\n\n\nDC Motor\n\u00b6\n\n\nA motor is a device which converts electrical energy into mechanical energy.\n* A generator running backward is called motor.\n* Principle of motor is that whenever a current carrying coil is placed in a magnetic field it experiences a couple of forces, which causes torque.\n\n\nBack EMF Effect in Motor\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\nThe self induced emf (\n\\(\\epsilon\\)\n) in a motor opposes the voltage \n\\(v\\)\n running the motor. Thus induced emf is called the back emf of motor.\n\n\nThe magnitude of back emf increases with the speed of motor.\n\n\n\\(V\\)\n & \n\\(\\epsilon\\)\n are in opposite polarity.\n\n\n\n\nCurrent flowing in motor is: $$ I=\\frac{(V-\\epsilon)}{R} \\;\\; \\implies \\;\\; V=\\epsilon + IR $$\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the motor speeds up, the back emf increases and the current become smaller and smaller. So current should be kept sufficient to provide torque.\n\n\n\n\nIf motor is overloaded, the back emf decreases and allow the motor to draw more current.\n\n\nIf motor is overloaded beyond its limits, the current could be so high that it may burn the motor coil.\n\n\n\n\nTransformer\n\u00b6\n\n\nTransformer is an electromagnetic device used to step up or step down AC voltage or AC current, not DC.\n\n\n\n\nPrinciple of transformer is the \nmutual induction\n.\n\n\nCoil of transformer where input is applied is called primary coil while other where output is obtained is called secondary coil.\n\n\nCore consist of laminated punched sheets of sotf iron on which coil is wound.\n\n\nLamination of core is done to reduce \neddy current losses\n (eddy current is and induced current produced in a core).\n\n\nTransformer can not step up or step down the energy or power.\n\n\nTransformer consumes very little part of input power so it can kept running hours without considerable loss of power. $$ \\frac{V_s}{V_p} =\\frac{N_s}{N_p}= \\frac{I_p}{I_s} $$\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInfo\n\n\nTransformer is one of the static devices in the electrical appliances. So there is no loss of energy in friction. Hence they can have higher efficiencies. We can achieve up to 95% efficient transformer.\n\n\n\n\nEnergy Losses\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\nCopper Losses in winding:\n Due to resistance of the winding of primary and secondary coil, some electrical energy is always lost in form of heat energy.\n\n\nFlux Losses:\n The coupling of the primary and secondary is never perfect and whole of magnetic flux produced in the primary coil does not link the secondary coil. This results in some energy loss.\n\n\nIron losses in core:\n Iron losses are of two types:\n\n\nEddy Current Loss:\n Due to the periodically varying nature of AC supplied in primary, the flux associated with core changes and therefore, eddy currents are induced in it. Eddy currents induced in the core are undesirable as they heat the core and result in energy loss. To minimize the eddy current losses, core is laminated.\n\n\nHysterisis Loss:\n The alternating current flowing through the coils magnetized and demagnitizes the iron core again and again. therefore, during each cycle of magnetizatio, same energy lost due to hysterisis. To minimize  this loss we choose material of core of smaller hysterisis loss generally soft iron.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEfficiency of Transformer\n\u00b6\n\n\nIdeal transformer efficiency is 100% or 1 but in actual tranformer output power is always less than inout power, so efficincy also always less than 100%. In general efficiency of transformer is very high and of the order of 90%.\n\n\n\n\nEfficiency is given by: $$ \\eta =\\frac{\\text{Output Power}}{\\text{Input Power}}\\times 100 $$\n\n\nIn terms of secondary and primary voltage and current $$ \\eta = \\frac{V_sI_s}{V_pI_p} $$\n\n\nAs, \n\\(\\text{Imput}=\\text{Output} + \\text{Losses}\\)\n so, $$ \\eta =\\frac{\\text{Output Power}}{\\text{Output Power} + \\text{Losses}} $$\n\n\n\n\nApplications\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\nThey are used in power distribution in a safe from power stations to the utility stations.\n\n\nThe principle of transmission is the that we reduce the value of current via increasing the transmission voltage so saving the cost of copper as less think wire can full fill the purpose due to small currents.\n\n\nTransformer also provide a degree of control of electricity distribution to a town.",

Coil of transformer where input is applied is called primary coil while other where output is obtained is called secondary coil.  Core consist of laminated punched sheets of sotf iron on which coil is wound.  Lamination of core is done to reduce  eddy current losses  (eddy current is and induced current produced in a core).  Transformer can not step up or step down the energy or power.  Transformer consumes very little part of input power so it can kept running hours without considerable loss of power. $$ \\frac{V_s}{V_p} =\\frac{N_s}{N_p}= \\frac{I_p}{I_s} $$    Info  Transformer is one of the static devices in the electrical appliances. So there is no loss of energy in friction. Hence they can have higher efficiencies. We can achieve up to 95% efficient transformer.",

Flux Losses:  The coupling of the primary and secondary is never perfect and whole of magnetic flux produced in the primary coil does not link the secondary coil. This results in some energy loss.  Iron losses in core:  Iron losses are of two types:  Eddy Current Loss:  Due to the periodically varying nature of AC supplied in primary, the flux associated with core changes and therefore, eddy currents are induced in it. Eddy currents induced in the core are undesirable as they heat the core and result in energy loss. To minimize the eddy current losses, core is laminated.  Hysterisis Loss:  The alternating current flowing through the coils magnetized and demagnitizes the iron core again and again. therefore, during each cycle of magnetizatio, same energy lost due to hysterisis. To minimize  this loss we choose material of core of smaller hysterisis loss generally soft iron.",

An isolated single atom possesses a number of discrete energy levels that can be occupied by electrons of the atom. Generally the electrons exist in the ground state, when excited electrons can shift to higher energy levels. Usually only the valence electrons can participate in these excitations.\n\n\n\n\nAn energy state, which cannot be occupied, is forbidden gap.\n\n\nThe band formed by a series of energy levels containing, the valence electrons is known as \nvalence band\n. The valence band may be partially or completely filled up depending upon the nature of the crystal.\n\n\nThe next higher permitted band is called as the \nconduction band\n. This band may be empty or partially filled. In conduction band the electrons can move freely.\n\n\nMetals have positive temperature coefficient (\n\\(\\alpha_t\\)\n) of resistance while semiconductors have negative (\n\\(\\alpha_t\\)\n).\n\n\n\n\nElectrical Classification of Solids\n\u00b6\n\n\nAll solids employed in electrical work may be classified into following three groups:\n\n\n\n\nConductors\n\n\nInsulators\n\n\nSemiconductors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConductors\n\n\nInsulators\n\n\nSemiconductors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the case of a conductor, there will be no forbidden energy gap. The conduction and valence energy bands overlap each other. Obviously, the electrons from the valence band can freely enter the conduction energy band.\n\n\nIn case of an insulators, the forbidden energy band is very wide and hence an electron cannot jump across, from the valence energy band to the conduction energy band. Only when a very large amount of energy is supplied, an electron may be able to jumps across the forbidden band. This explains why certain materials which are perfect insulators behave as conductors only at very high temperatures. In case of diamond, the forbidden energy gap is nearly \n\\(6eV\\)\n.\n\n\nIn the case of semiconductors, the forbidden energy band is comparatively small. For example \n\\(0.7eV\\)\n for (\n\\(Ge\\)\n) and \n\\(1.1eV\\)\n for silicon. In these cases, when a small amount of energy is supplied, the electrons can easily jump across the forbidden energy band and reach the conduction energy band.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn conductors, charge carries responsible for the conduction of electricity are \nfree electrons\n.\n\n\nIn insulators, no free electrons are available for conduction.\n\n\nSemiconductors has a much smaller energy gap (\n\\(E_g\\)\n) between the top of the highest filled band (called \nvalence band\n) and the bottom of the vacant band just above it called the \nconduction band\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe electrical conductivity of conductors is of the order of \n\\(10^8\\Omega m^{-1}\\)\n\n\nThe electrical conductivity of insulators is very low in the range \n\\(10^{-16}\\)\n to \n\\(10^{-6}\\Omega m^{-1}\\)\n\n\nThe conductivity of semiconductors is of the order of \n\\(1\\Omega m^{-1}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMetallic conductors have positive temperature coefficient of resistance.\n\n\nIn insulators, the valence band is completely filled while conduction band is completely empty.\n\n\nSemiconductors have negative temperature coefficient of resistance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe resistance of conductor increases due to addition of impurities.\n\n\nIonic crystal are insulators. The other examples are glass, wood, paper, mica, diamond, ceramic, plastic etc.\n\n\nThe resistance of semiconductor decreases due to the addition of impurities. At absolute zero temperature, conduction band is completely behaves as an insulators.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nType of Semiconductors\n\u00b6\n\n\nThere are two types of semiconductors:\n\n\n\n\nN-type

carriers, whereas holes are called minority charge carriers.\n\n\nIn P-type semiconductor holes are majority charge carriers while electrons are minority charge carriers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn N-type semiconductor, the Fermi level shift towards the conduction band.\n\n\nThere is no charge on P-type semiconductor also, because it is formed by the combination of free positive charged holes and fixed negatively charges acceptor ions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is no charge on N-type semiconductor because it is formed by the combination of free negatively charges electrons and fixed majority carrier.\n\n\nThere is no charge on P-type semiconductor also, because it is formed by the combination of free positively charged holes and fixed negatively charged acceptor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe
