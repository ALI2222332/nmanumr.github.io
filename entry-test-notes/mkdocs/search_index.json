The magnetic field exerts force on the current carrying coil. This force produces a counter torque that opposes the rotational motion of coil. This effect is called back motor effect of generator.\n\n\nAccording to law of conservation of energy, the energy consumed by the load must come from the energy source used to drive turbines.\n\n\nThe larger the current drawn by the load, the greater is the counter torque produced.\n\n\n\n\nDC Motor\n\u00b6\n\n\nA motor is a device which converts electrical energy into mechanical energy.\n* A generator running backward is called motor.\n* Principle of motor is that whenever a current carrying coil is placed in a magnetic field it experiences a couple of forces, which causes torque.\n\n\nBack EMF Effect in Motor\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\nThe self induced emf (\n\\(\\epsilon\\)\n) in a motor opposes the voltage \n\\(v\\)\n running the motor. Thus induced emf is called the back emf of motor.\n\n\nThe magnitude of back emf increases with the speed of motor.\n\n\n\\(V\\)\n & \n\\(\\epsilon\\)\n are in opposite polarity.\n\n\n\n\nCurrent flowing in motor is: $$ I=\\frac{(V-\\epsilon)}{R} \\;\\; \\implies \\;\\; V=\\epsilon + IR $$\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the motor speeds up, the back emf increases and the current become smaller and smaller. So current should be kept sufficient to provide torque.\n\n\n\n\nIf motor is overloaded, the back emf decreases and allow the motor to draw more current.\n\n\nIf motor is overloaded beyond its limits, the current could be so high that it may burn the motor coil.\n\n\n\n\nTransformer\n\u00b6\n\n\nTransformer is an electromagnetic device used to step up or step down AC voltage or AC current, not DC.\n\n\n\n\nPrinciple of transformer is the \nmutual induction\n.\n\n\nCoil of transformer where input is applied is called primary coil while other where output is obtained is called secondary coil.\n\n\nCore consist of laminated punched sheets of sotf iron on which coil is wound.\n\n\nLamination of core is done to reduce \neddy current losses\n (eddy current is and induced current produced in a core).\n\n\nTransformer can not step up or step down the energy or power.\n\n\nTransformer consumes very little part of input power so it can kept running hours without considerable loss of power. $$ \\frac{V_s}{V_p} =\\frac{N_s}{N_p}= \\frac{I_p}{I_s} $$\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInfo\n\n\nTransformer is one of the static devices in the electrical appliances. So there is no loss of energy in friction. Hence they can have higher efficiencies. We can achieve up to 95% efficient transformer.\n\n\n\n\nEnergy Losses\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\nCopper Losses in winding:\n Due to resistance of the winding of primary and secondary coil, some electrical energy is always lost in form of heat energy.\n\n\nFlux Losses:\n The coupling of the primary and secondary is never perfect and whole of magnetic flux produced in the primary coil does not link the secondary coil. This results in some energy loss.\n\n\nIron losses in core:\n Iron losses are of two types:\n\n\nEddy Current Loss:\n Due to the periodically varying nature of AC supplied in primary, the flux associated with core changes and therefore, eddy currents are induced in it. Eddy currents induced in the core are undesirable as they heat the core and result in energy loss. To minimize the eddy current losses, core is laminated.\n\n\nHysterisis Loss:\n The alternating current flowing through the coils magnetized and demagnitizes the iron core again and again. therefore, during each cycle of magnetizatio, same energy lost due to hysterisis.
