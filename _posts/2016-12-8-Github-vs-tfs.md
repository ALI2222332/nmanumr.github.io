Recently, Microsoft introduced Team Foundation Server(TFS). In this article I am going to compare **Github** with **Microsoft Team Foundation Server**.
<!--more-->
#### What is Microsoft Team Foundation Server?
Team Foundation Server (also abbreviated as TFS) provides hosting of projects for individuals and companies. TFS also provides great tools and features that support both agile and waterfall. It also provides automatic test and release functionality.

> Team Foundation Server delivers source control, work item tracking, Team Foundation Build, a team project portal Web site, reporting, and project management capabilities.

#### What is Github?
Github also provides hosting for projects. But it  was lunched about 8 years ago. It mainly focused on open source projects but for private repositories you must have to pay $7/mounth.

> GitHub is a web-based Git repository hosting service. It offers all of the distributed version control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git as well as adding its own features. It provides access control and several collaboration features such as bug tracking, feature requests, task management, and wikis for every project.

Now let's compare these two services:

##### 1. Editor
Github recently updated its editor that is much more better but TFS uses monaco editor, the same editor that is used in visual studio code and Github editor is nothing infront of that.

#### 2. Git Support
Github support for git is great but TFS support for git is limited but it also supports TFVC.

#### 3. Users Limit
Github has no limit of collaborators in a repo but TFS just supports 5 users on a project for free.

#### 4. Projects Limit
Both Github and TFS supports unlimited number of projects for free.

#### 5. Public & Private Repo
Github suppports both public and private repos but it charge $5 from individuals and $7 from orgnizations. But TFS only supports private repos.

#### 6. Agile Support
TFS supports Agile software development life cycle by providing different toolts.
> Enable your custom agile processes. Capture, prioritize, and track work with backlogs and customize-able Kanban boards. Ensure transparency and traceability with work items linked directly to code and builds. Customize rich dashboards for easy reporting.
But, Github lacks this feature.

#### Conclusion
If you want private work TFS is the best solution. But, if you to public your work then github is only solution.
