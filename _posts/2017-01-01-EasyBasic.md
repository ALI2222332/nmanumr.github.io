Hi everybody, after working on a GUI based IDE ([GwBasic.Net](https://naumanumer.github.io/gwbasic.net)) and then Easybasic ([EasyBasic](https://naumanumer.github.io/easybasic)) for 1 year now we able to imagine the final shape of EasyBasic. And today I am going to explain it in this blog post.

#### History
But before this let's take a short look at easybasic histroy.

##### GwBasic Syntax Editor
An year ago I worte a sytax editor for gwbasic and called it as **GwBasic Syntax Editor**. I wrote it usimg c# winform.

##### GwBasic.Net
After that I enhanced and added some example codes and support to execute GwBasic code using PcBasic and called it as **GwBasic.Net**. It is also written using c# winfom. As it it written using .net framework that is why it is called as GwBasic.Net.

##### EasyBasic
After that I wrote GwBasic.Net using electron.js as I need it to be stylish and cross plateform. As I changed the plateform, style and even idea, I also renamed it and alos changed icon. And, at that time i was thinking to make it as a learning tool. But I was very confused if I have to create a learning tool or an IDE.


Now I am going to make easybasic a complete package that contains following:

1. Easybasic IDE
2. Easybasic Help
3. Easybasic Tutor
4. Easybasic Server
5. Easybasic Shell
6. Easybasic Utilities
   * Graphics Editor
   * File Merger
7. And much more
